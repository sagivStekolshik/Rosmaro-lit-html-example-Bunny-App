This is an example of a client-side application implemented using [Rosmaro](https://rosmaro.js.org) and [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html).

A _Rosmaro model_ is responsible for handling changes of behavior (and data), and _lit-html_ renders the view. 

[Rosmaro Editor](https://rosmaro.js.org/editor) was used to draw the _graph.json_ file.
[Rosmaro for lit-html] was used to integrate React with Rosmaro.
[webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/cvgellhorn/webpack-boilerplate) was used to bootstrap this demo.

There is __1 IF statement__ responsible for the logic.
